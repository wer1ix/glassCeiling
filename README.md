# Glass Ceiling
An analysis which intends to provide a focus on current stoppers which avoid payment equality based on gender. We'll explore different official sources from Mexican Government to determine if there's sufficient evidence to still determine a glass ceiling over mexican women; after concluding, we'll provide our POV in how companies need and could change in order to lower the disparity between genders.

## Objective:
To provide a visualization about how mexican women are far behind men onto labour positions per entity on Mexican Republic. <br />
By definition, the glass ceiling represents an obstacle for women to be present and grow within organizations;therefore is necesary that companies push efficient actions for a change to be really made and to close both the representation of women in power places and salary gap.
