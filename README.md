# Glass Ceiling
An analysis which intends to provide a focus on current stoppers which avoid payment equality based on gender. We'll explore different official sources from Mexican Government to determine if there's sufficient evidence to still determine a glass ceiling over mexican women; after concluding, we'll provide our POV in how companies need and could change in order to lower the disparity between genders.

## Objective:
To provide a visualization about how mexican women are far behind men onto labour positions per entity on Mexican Republic.

## Summary
By definition, the glass ceiling represents an obstacle for women to be present and grow within organizations;therefore is necesary that companies push efficient actions for a change to be really made and to close both the representation of women in power places and salary gap. <br />
In a country like Mexico, where machism is still up to date, we need to propose realistic targets and efficient hiring process to ensure women won't be taking part on further discriminations or offered lower pay-gap than their male co-workers.
By far this brief approach we'll intend to provide an entry level description of how different statistical indicators show current women status on the country; through visualizations and tables. 

## Future Steps
The intention is to make this repository as robust and extend so it can be used as the main nacional visualization repository for different gender based indicators. Also gather the different indicators for which this study was not able to access in order to have a broader POV.

## Conclusions
There's still a huge disparity per gender on salary earning and economical ocupation. This study is not considering unpaid work, in which we have full confidence there's a significant prove about how women are still seen as care-givers and not really work-force.
